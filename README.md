Inspired by [unbury.me](https://unbury.me/) and [unbury.us](http://unbury.us/)

Built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), 
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/), 
[Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/), [Date.js](http://www.datejs.com/), 
and some custom built HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

TODO LIST:

- Keep track of each loans amortization table separately instead of jointly
- Once we have separate amortization tables, add separate rows for each loan'separate
  full amortization table
- Implement a back-end to store loans entered
